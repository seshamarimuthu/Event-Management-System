$db = "events_db";

$conn = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $db);
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
```

### 5. Configure PHPMailer (Optional)
if you change your domain email credentials, update the following in the /event-management-system/frontend/book.php file:
```php

$mailerEmail ='your_email@example.com'; 
$mailerPassword ='your_password';   
$mailerName = 'Your Name';

```
